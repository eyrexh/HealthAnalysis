1. [BC Health - Comparison of PharmaCare Claims, 2006-11](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-health-comparison-of-pharmacare-claims-2006-11)

2. [BC Health - Services, Patient Counts and Expenditures by Gender, Age Group, Fiscal Year, from MSP](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-health-services-patient-counts-and-expenditures-by-gender-age-group-fiscal-year-from-msp)


## Dashboard Preview and Description

In this dashboard, you can select the year from 2005 to 2010 and choose from the following 7 plans in BC:
- Fair PharmaCare (Plan I)
- Permanent Residents of Licensed Residential Care Facilities (Plan B)
- Recipients of B.C. Income Assistance (Plan C)
- Patients Registered with a Provincial Cystic Fibrosis Clinic (Plan D)
- Children Eligible Through the At Home Program of the Ministry of Children and Family Development (Plan F)
- No-Charge Psychiatric Medication Plan (Plan G)
- Palliative Care Drug Plan (Plan P)

Additionally, you can choose between two different services: "Medical" and "Other Health Practitioners."

The dashboard is divided into three sections:

1. The Summary Statistics Info: This section displays important statistics for the total amount of all the plans in your chosen year, including:

- Average Claims per Beneficiary
- Total Beneficiaries
- Total Claims
- Total Amount Paid

2. The Bar Chart: This chart visualizes the selected statistics for the chosen year and multiple plans. It allows for easy comparison with the total summary statistics info.

3. The Pie Charts: There are two pie charts in this section:

- The first pie chart shows the percentage of patients in different age groups for the chosen year and selected service.
- The second pie chart displays the percentage of expenditures in different age groups for the chosen year and selected service.
